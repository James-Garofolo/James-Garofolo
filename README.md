Hi, Iâ€™m @James-Garofolo

I'm currently a Masters student in the Optics Lab at Rowan University, studying neuromorphic computing and machine learning. I also work in the domains of signal processing, UX/UI design and embedded systems design. 

I mostly program in Python, but am comfortable with Matlab, C, C++, Verilog HDL and Basic as well.
